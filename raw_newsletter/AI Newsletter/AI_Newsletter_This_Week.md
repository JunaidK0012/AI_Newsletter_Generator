## 🌟 Big Story of the Week
### **Google Releases Veo, Its Most Advanced Text-to-Video Generation Model**
Google has unveiled Veo, a new flagship text-to-video model designed to compete with OpenAI's Sora. Veo can generate high-quality, 1080p videos longer than a minute, with a deep understanding of cinematic language and visual semantics. The model is currently available to a select group of creators through a private preview in VideoFX, a new tool on the Google Labs platform.

> **Why it matters:**
> The release of Veo marks a significant step forward in the generative video race, putting Google in direct competition with other major players like OpenAI. This technology has the potential to revolutionize content creation, from filmmaking to marketing, by making high-quality video production more accessible.

## 📑 Top Research Papers
- **Inductive or Deductive? Rethinking the Fundamental Reasoning Abilities of LLMs:** This paper finds that while LLMs excel at inductive reasoning, they struggle with deductive and counterfactual reasoning, suggesting a need for more nuanced evaluation of their capabilities. [arXiv PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00114v2)
- **DOTS: Learning to Reason Dynamically in LLMs:** Researchers propose a new method that allows LLMs to dynamically choose the best reasoning "actions" for a given question, potentially leading to more efficient and flexible problem-solving. [arXiv PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03864v2)
- **MultiNRC: A Challenging and Native Multilingual Reasoning Benchmark:** This new benchmark introduces over 1,000 native reasoning questions in French, Spanish, and Chinese to better evaluate the multicultural and multilingual abilities of LLMs beyond English-centric tests. [arXiv PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17476v1)
