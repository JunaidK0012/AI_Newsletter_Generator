## 🌟 Big Story of the Week  
### **Agentic AI: From Chatbots to Autonomous Problem-Solvers**  
The AI world is buzzing about the rise of **agentic AI systems** — models that don’t just respond, but **plan, reason, use tools, and take actions autonomously**.

Recent moves by **OpenAI, Anthropic, and LangChain** highlight this shift, introducing frameworks that allow AI to chain tasks, interact with APIs, and act as intelligent digital assistants.

> **Why it matters:**  
> This could be the next big leap after chatbots — toward **true digital co-workers** capable of managing workflows and executing goals independently.
