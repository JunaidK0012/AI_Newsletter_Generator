## Tool Spotlight (Optional Deep Dive)

**Tool Name:** FlowiseAI

**Why it stands out:** FlowiseAI is gaining traction for its user-friendly, visual approach to building complex AI applications. It allows developers and non-developers alike to drag-and-drop different components (LLMs, tools, data sources) to create powerful AI agents and workflows. This lowers the barrier to entry for building with LLMs and enables rapid prototyping and experimentation.
