1. **Name of the Paper**: Goldfish: Monolingual Language Models for 350 Languages

**Publisher:** arXiv

**Description:** This paper introduces Goldfish, a suite of monolingual autoregressive Transformer language models for 350 languages, many of which are low-resource. The authors find that these smaller, monolingual models often outperform large multilingual models like BLOOM and XGLM in terms of perplexity for many languages. This suggests that for low-resource languages, focusing on monolingual training can be more effective for text generation tasks than relying on massive multilingual models.

**Possible Impact:** The release of Goldfish models could significantly impact NLP research for low-resource languages. Researchers and developers working on applications for these languages will have access to high-quality monolingual models, which can serve as better baselines and starting points for fine-tuning. This could lead to improved performance in a variety of downstream tasks for languages that have been traditionally underserved by large language models.

2. **Name of the Paper**: Lost in Translation: Large Language Models in Non-English Content Analysis

**Publisher:** arXiv

**Description:** This paper explores the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) when applied to non-English content analysis. It provides a technical explanation of multilingual language models, discusses the challenges of using them for content analysis, and offers recommendations for companies, researchers, and policymakers. The authors highlight the data gap between English and other languages and how this affects the performance of multilingual models.

**Possible Impact:** This paper serves as a critical reminder of the English-centric nature of current AI development. It could influence researchers and developers to be more cautious when applying LLMs to non-English contexts and encourage the development of more equitable and effective multilingual systems. The recommendations could also guide policy decisions to ensure that AI technologies are beneficial for a global audience.
